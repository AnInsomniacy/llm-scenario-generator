You are an expert Scenic code integrator. Your task is to merge and refactor the following discrete Scenic code components into a single, coherent, and optimized simulation scenario.

SCENARIO DESCRIPTION:
{scenario_description}

MAP INFORMATION:
{town}

SCENIC HEADER:
{scenic_header}

BEHAVIOR CODE:
{behavior_code}

GEOMETRY CODE:
{geometry_code}

SPAWN CODE:
{spawn_code}

INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. Eliminate code redundancy and duplicate definitions
2. Optimize variable naming for clarity and consistency
3. Ensure proper logical flow and execution order
4. Resolve any syntax conflicts or inconsistencies
5. Maintain complete scenario semantics
6. Follow Scenic language best practices
7. Create clean, readable, and maintainable code structure

OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Generate a complete, executable Scenic file
- Start with scenario description as docstring
- Include all necessary imports and parameters
- Organize code in logical sections: headers, behaviors, geometry, spawning
- Ensure all variables are properly defined before use
- Remove any placeholder comments or debug statements
- Optimize for performance and readability

Provide only the final integrated Scenic code without explanations or comments.
